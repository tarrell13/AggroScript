## Synopsis:

Aggressor Script automates the generation of a HTML document containing a link to all payloads for easy testing. Automation is performed by retrieving a listing of all payloads under the Sites tab. After retrieving the payloads, each page is linked within an unordered list. 

## Example:

1. Payloads currently listed under Attacks -> Manage
